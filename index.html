                    I met Kani, Yan and others and reviewed many contents of Code Chrysalis and it was cool.
                    Finally I enrolled in Code Chrysalis Cohort 6! I'm so excited now, how amazing people I will meet.
                    Thank God.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    IT bubble(?) had been already bursted and economic status had been getting worse by some reasons at that moment.
                    Fukusima earthquake happened on March 2011 and many people who I know got out of this country and I heard radiation was coming to Tokyo.
                    Oh my God, what's going on? There was no water, rice, tissue... in my town.<br>
                    For over 8 years I did my best seriously and really tried not to complain no matter how worse economic status, disaster and whatever got.
                    But boring works without a feature, helpless things not related to a development such as empty a trash can, dealing with stupid manners of people in the office and so on made me extremely tired.
                    I thought that I should find a something to escape this situation and I realized I need a great environment and amazing mentors.
                    And I have almost done with the one.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    In March 2010, I came to Japan with nothing even no Japanese knowledge, beautiful and well organized and kind, by my desire to work abroad and find something awesome through the new experiences of the new environment.
                    I was so excited because it was the my first experience being abroad ever!
                    Let's go!

                Hello! I'm Daenam, I am really interested in the development from when I was high school student because it's fun.
                At that moment, I learned about an embedded system and harware things.
                After I came to Japan, I tried to become a good web developer.
                Finally I got a chance to be at Code Chrysalis.
