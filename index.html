                    In 2018, I found the one, through complicated routes, Code Chrysalis! After meeting Kani, Yan, and others and reviewing the curriculum thoroughly,
                    I decided to join the crew of Code Chrysalis Cohort 6 not only because I could develop myself as an engineer but also because I could build tight relationships with amazing people.<br>
                    I am very looking forward to this opportunity and want to thank God for leading me into the right direction!

                  <p class="card-text">
                    I was accountable for developing solutions and doing SI works at the last two companies. The projects I dealt with were a business card solution, an AR service solution, a MDM(Mobile Device Management) solution, a digital marketing solution and etc.
                    As a tech lead at my last company, I introduced and designed DevOps with numerous tools to reduce the communication problems among developers and management analysts.<br>
                    ** For over 8 years, I worked diligently without complaining no matter what the circumstances I was in. I will tell you, It was NOT SO FUN. However, I managed myself getting through those hardships and found this wonderful opportunity to HAVE FUN!

                  <p class="card-text">
                    In March 2010, I came to Japan to widen my perspectives learning new cultures and building bonds with different people.
                    It was not as easy as I thought because I had no knowledge of Japan including languages, friends, and culture whatsoever.<br>
                    Right now, I have a family with a loving wife and blessed two kids. Not only that, I learned English and Japanese.
                    I am still not sure if I did well until now, but I am very proud and thankful for such blessings and want to continue to have the positive atmosphere!
